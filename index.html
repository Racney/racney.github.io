        <p class="content"><span>Oct 15 (Reuters)</span> - Facebook parent company Meta (META.O), opens new tab must face lawsuits by U.S. states accusing it of fueling mental health problems among teens by making its Facebook and Instagram platforms addictive, a federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday.
            Oakland-based U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected Meta's bid to toss the claims made by the states in two separate lawsuits filed last year, one involving more than 30 states including California and New York and the other brought by Florida.Rogers put some limits on the states' claims, agreeing with Meta that a federal law known as Section 230 regulating online platforms partly shielded the company. However, she found that the states had put forward enough detail about allegedly misleading statements made by the company to go forward with most of their case.

            This innovative product aims to provide men with a safe and effective contraceptive option, marking a significant breakthrough in the field of reproductive control.The device works by submerging the male testicles in a solution that effectively lowers testicular temperature and regulates hormone levels, temporarily interrupting sperm production. Research has shown that this solution can significantly reduce sperm counts in men using the device, achieving a contraceptive success rate of up to 98%.
